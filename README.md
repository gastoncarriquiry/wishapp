# WishApp

WishApp is a wishlist manager. Ideally it would connect to different online shops (i.e Zara, H&M, Amazon) and display all your liked items in one place. Due to scarce resources and knowledge, the project remains simple and is limited to manual addition of products. 

This project is a Single-Page Application. It has both frontend and backend features. It was developed with NodeJs, Express framework and MongoDB's non-relational database.

Lastly, go to `index.js` and change `DBconnection` in line 10 to your own MongoDB cluster connection.

The connection URL should look like this:

  `mongodb+srv://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASS}@cluster0.cwrzz.mongodb.net/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
